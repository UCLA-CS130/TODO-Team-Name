CS130 Project - Web Server
=============================================================================

Current code is a demo example from the getting started page at:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html

Uses boost regex library to test out the linking process. Invoke with:
$ ./webserver < jayne.txt

Works only for my local machine. My library binaries are installed in a 
pretty wonky spot too so the Makefile paths need to be changed in the future.
